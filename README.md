# NoStorageRestrict

![](https://i.imgur.com/Z7VH0Li.jpg)

Removes the restriction when selecting folders (Android, Downloads, data and obb) through the file manager on Android 11 and higher

## Disclaimer
- In most cases DO NOT enable the module for the files app (only keep it enabled for the External Storage app), only enable it for the Files app when you want an app to be able to access something on /Android/data through the files app, otherwise keep it only enabled for the External Storage app
