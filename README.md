# NoStorageRestrict

![](https://i.imgur.com/Z7VH0Li.jpg)

Removes the restriction when selecting folders (Android, Downloads, data and obb) through the file manager on Android 11 and higher

## Disclaimer
- For most cases DO NOT enable the module for the files app, only do so when you want an app to be able to access something on /Android/data through the files app, otherwise keep it DISABLED
